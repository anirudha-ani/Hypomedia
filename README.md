# Hypomedia

## Description 

The project is an innovative audio-based temporal note-taking app that leverages Google Speech To Text and GeoLocation APIs to provide an efficient and intuitive note-taking experience. The app allows users to create and manage notes by recording audio, which is then transcribed into text using Google Speech To Text. Additionally, the app incorporates GeoLocation APIs to automatically tag notes with the user's location data, providing an added layer of context to their notes.

To enhance the note-taking experience, the app supports a rich text WYSIWYG editing interface using the TipTap library. Users can easily format and style their notes, add images, and create lists, among other features. To make note-taking even more flexible, the app introduces cross-note linking and annotating using React Router and MongoDB, allowing users to link and annotate their notes across different topics.

To make the app globally accessible, the MongoDB backend is deployed on Heroku, while the React frontend is hosted on the Firebase server. This ensures that users can access their notes from anywhere in the world, and their data is securely stored in the cloud. Overall, this project provides a seamless, easy-to-use, and flexible note-taking solution that is perfect for users who need to capture ideas and thoughts of the people around them in social setup.
